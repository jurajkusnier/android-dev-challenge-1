# Adopt Me!

![Workflow result](https://github.com/jurajkusnier/android-dev-challenge-1/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
Do you want to adopt a puppy, kitten, or hamster? This app is for you!


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This app was created during [Android Dev Challenge](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/02/android-dev-challenge-lift-off-with.html).
UI is written fully in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). I'm proud I was able to implement this nice-looking demo app even without any previous Jetpack Compose knowledge.
The app design was inspired by an app template from dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/7438702-Pet-Sharing-App
